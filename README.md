A project assignment from class: text sentiment analysis on predicting categories of pet adoption speed using supervised machine learning technique. 

Original upload was on Kaggle. See [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/maoyinan/analysis-on-text-sentiment/notebook). 

Pets from an adoption center were adopted with different speed categories: 
Same day as the listing, Btw 1 and 7 days, Btw 8 and 30 days, Btw 31 and 90 days, No adoption after 100 days. 
A successful classification algorithm would improve the efficiency of managing the adoption center.
Input data include: the breed of pet, color, location of state, description. 
Apart from categorical variables, the dataset also contains a text description of the pet, which requires in-depth language processing for better prediction.

The final target is to generate predicted labels for the test dataset and prepare in a file named 'submission.csv'.
